**ARI (Abstract Reasoning Induction)** is an innovative framework designed to enhance the temporal reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). By dividing the reasoning process into two distinct phasesâ€”Knowledge-agnostic and Knowledge-basedâ€”ARI aims to mitigate the issues of hallucinations and improve LLMs' ability to integrate abstract methodologies derived from historical data.
